# Dockerfile Build Failure: Missing or Incorrect requirements.txt

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when building Docker images: issues with the `requirements.txt` file used for installing Python packages.

The `Dockerfile` in this repository contains a flaw that leads to a build failure.  The solution is provided in `Dockerfile-solution`.

**Problem:** The original `Dockerfile` might have an incorrect path to `requirements.txt`, or the file itself may be missing from the context passed to the Docker build command.

**Solution:** Ensure the `requirements.txt` file is present in the same directory as the Dockerfile and that the COPY command correctly references its location. If you are using a different directory structure, adjust the `COPY` command accordingly.
